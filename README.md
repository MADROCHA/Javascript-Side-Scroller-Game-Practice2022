## Description

Practice to build a 2D side scroll game using html, css and javascript.

## Controls

## _Notes 1.0_
 - Able to change movement while jump is active, direction forward or backwards.
 - To retry you'll need to reload.
 - Collision hitboxes aren't perfect fit to strokes & circles around characters on screen.
